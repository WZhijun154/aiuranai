# Building AI-Powered Websites with NextJS and Vercel AI SDK

I'm currently exploring the intersection of modern web development and artificial intelligence by building [AI占い](https://aiuranai.org) - a website that incorporates AI capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a practical exercise in implementing AI features within a NextJS application using the Vercel AI SDK. The combination of these technologies enables:

- Real-time AI-powered interactions
- Streamlined development workflow
- Optimized performance for AI-driven features

## Tech Stack

- **NextJS**: For server-side rendering and static site generation
- **Vercel AI SDK**: To integrate AI capabilities seamlessly
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and utility-first styling
- **React**: For building interactive UI components

## Development Process

Working with the Vercel AI SDK has provided an efficient way to incorporate AI functionality without handling complex infrastructure setup. The SDK's built-in components and hooks make it straightforward to implement features like:

- AI-powered chat interfaces
- Content generation
- Smart recommendations
- Natural language processing capabilities

The project continues to evolve as I explore more advanced AI integration patterns within the NextJS framework.
